 * component for a maximum of around 100 views displayed at one time.
 *
 * This is implemented with view annotations on [Android](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/maps/guides/annotations/view-annotations/)
 * and [iOS](https://docs.mapbox.com/ios/maps/guides/annotations/view-annotations).
 *
 * This component has no dedicated `onPress` method. Instead, you should handle gestures
 * with the React views passed in as `children`.
